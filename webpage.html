                <p>Set on a clifftop on the South Devon coast, Carswell Farm near Holbeton is the setting for our little festival wedding.</p>
                <p>Think a bloody great tent in a field by the sea, throw in some great food and drink, a fire pit, garden games and singing and dancing our way into the night!</p>

                <h3>Schedule</h3>
                    <p>Timing on the day will be fairly loose but the rough schedule we'll be keeping to is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1630hrs Arrival</li>
                        <li>1730hrs Speeches</li>
                        <li>1900hrs Grubs up!</li>

                    </ul>
                
                <h3>Getting there!</h3>
                    <p>The postcode for the nearest <i>property</i> to the Wedding Field is <b>PL8 1HG</b></p> 
                    <p>BUT WE STRONGLY ADVISE NOT TO FOLLOW A SATNAV AS THEY DON’T LIKE SMALL DEVON ROADS!</p>

                <h3>Approaching from Exeter/M5</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>When the M5 ends at Exeter, take the A38 for Plymouth. Stay put on this road for around 26 miles.</li>
                    <li>One mile west of South Brent (shortly after passing the Shell garage on your right), turn left at the WRANGATON intersection signed to <b>Ermington A3121 and Yealmpton A379</b>. Turn left at the give way at the top of the intersection.</li>
                    <li>Continue for 1 mile to crossroads with a give way sign and turn right onto A3121. Keep on this road for several miles past Ugborough and Ermington.</li>
                    <li>Half a mile past Ermington, stop at a halt sign and turn right onto the A379 towards Plymouth (BE CAREFUL - DANGEROUS TURNING). After about half a mile, as you come to the top of a gentle hill, turn left following signs for Holbeton and Mothecombe.</li>
                    <li>Continue along this road. You will see signs to Holbeton village off to the left but DO NOT follow these. Continue along the same road which is signposted to Stoke Beach.                    </li>
                    <li>Still following signs for Stoke, go straight through the hamlet of Battisborough Cross. You keep going along this road for about half a mile. You will pass the entrance to Carswell Farm on your left and the entrances to Poole Farm and then Lambside Farm on your right. Keep going straight on past Eastern Lodge (with the wonky chimneys!) and past a turning on your right signposted to Membland. Very soon after this you will see the wooden gates into the wedding field on your left hand side!</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Approaching from Plymouth</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Leave Plymouth on the A379 for Kingsbridge.</li>
                    <li>Stay on the A379 for around 6 miles, through Brixton and Yealmpton.</li>
                    <li>Around 2 miles past Yealmpton, take the RIGHT hand turning signposted Holbeton then continue as per above instructions from point 5 above.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Dress code</h3>
                    <p>Colours and lots of them.</p>
                    <p>Glitter is actively encouraged.</p>
                    <p>Appropriate footwear - you’ll be partying in a field! Think flats, chunky heels, or even wellies - weather dependent!</p>
                
                <h3>Food, Drink & Tunes</h3>
                    <p>We’ll be serving up a top notch hog roast with all the trimmings. So please tell us if you're a meat eater, a veggie, a vegan and/or have any special dietary requirements in the form below.</p>
                    <p>If you are filling out the form on behalf of someone else, please put their name and individual dietary requirements.</p>
                    <p>Bring Your Own Beer! (We know you’d all do it anyway, even if there was a proper bar!)</p>
                    <p>Tunes will be banging (it's a festival) BUT we also want to hear your song suggestions too. When you fill in your food choice, pop in a song suggestion in the form too.</p>
