                    <p>The postcode for the nearest <i>property</i> to the Wedding Field is <b>PL8 1HG</b></p> 
                    <p><u>BUT WE STRONGLY ADVISE NOT TO FOLLOW A SATNAV AS THEY DON’T LIKE SMALL DEVON ROADS!</u></p>

            <h3 class="content-sub-headings">Approaching from Exeter/M5</h3>
                <div class="content-info">
                <ol>
                    <li>When the M5 ends at Exeter, take the A38 for Plymouth. Stay put on this road for around 26 miles.</li>
                    <li>One mile west of South Brent (shortly after passing the Shell garage on your right), turn left at the WRANGATON intersection signed to <b>Ermington A3121 and Yealmpton A379</b>. Turn left at the give way at the top of the intersection.</li>
                    <li>Continue for 1 mile to crossroads with a give way sign and turn right onto A3121. Keep on this road for several miles past Ugborough and Ermington.</li>
                    <li>Half a mile past Ermington, stop at a halt sign and turn right onto the A379 towards Plymouth (BE CAREFUL - DANGEROUS TURNING). After about half a mile, as you come to the top of a gentle hill, turn left following signs for Holbeton and Mothecombe.</li>
                    <li>Continue along this road. You will see signs to Holbeton village off to the left but DO NOT follow these. Continue along the same road which is signposted to Stoke Beach.                    </li>
                    <li>Still following signs for Stoke, go straight through the hamlet of Battisborough Cross. You keep going along this road for about half a mile. You will pass the entrance to Carswell Farm on your left and the entrances to Poole Farm and then Lambside Farm on your right. Keep going straight on past Eastern Lodge (with the wonky chimneys!) and past a turning on your right signposted to Membland. Very soon after this you will see the wooden gates into the wedding field on your left hand side!</li>
                </ol>
                </div>

            <h3 class="content-sub-headings">Approaching from Plymouth</h3>
                <div class="content-info">
                <ol>
                    <li>Leave Plymouth on the A379 for Kingsbridge.</li>
                    <li>Stay on the A379 for around 6 miles, through Brixton and Yealmpton.</li>
                    <li>Around 2 miles past Yealmpton, take the RIGHT hand turning signposted Holbeton then continue as per above instructions from point 5 above.</li>
